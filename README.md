To play the Bouncy Ball Game, open both the HTML and JavaScript file in the browser. Once you get the game up and running, hover or click with your mouse under the clear screen button to create vivid balls that endlessly bounce around your screen... atleast until you clear the screen using the clear screen button! Enjoy!

To play the Guessing Game, open the file in the browser. Once you get the game up and running, keep guessing a number between 1 and 100 until you get it right. Try to get it in the least number of tries! Enjoy!

To use the Investment Calculator, open its file in the browser. Once the site loads, enter how much you want to save per month, your monthly interest, and the number of years you plan to invest for. After that click the calculate button and Enjoy!
